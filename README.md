Slash16 is a network of peoples who are passionate by system and network administration and/or DevOps. This subject follows Init where you have learn some of basics commands and first reflexes in system and network administration. This one will be a concrete exemple of the use of those commands and will let you start your own first web server. This is why we’ve decided to offer you three subjects and not two (Surprise!) • Initiation subject (Init). • A subject about VM creation (Roger-Skyline-1). • A subject about the creation of a full infrastructure (Roger-Skyline-2). You will also find some videos in the e-learning of your intra to learn basic notions.
